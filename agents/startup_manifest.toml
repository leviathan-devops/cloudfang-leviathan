# LEVIATHAN STARTUP MANIFEST
# =========================
# All agents listed here will be auto-spawned on kernel boot.
# The kernel reads this file during initialization and spawns any
# agents that don't already exist (idempotent).
#
# This fixes BUG-007: Dynamic agents lost on Railway deploy.
#
# Format: Each [[agent]] block maps directly to agent.toml format.
# The kernel iterates through all blocks and calls spawn_agent() for each.
